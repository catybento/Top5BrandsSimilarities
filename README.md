# Top 5 Brands Similarities

#### Final Project of the AI Course - Samsung Innovation Campus

When a new brand is registered, its image has to be different from all the others already registered.
Thus, the objective of this project is to show the **5 most similar brand images** from a database, comparing with the new brand to be registered.

To accomplish that, *Siamese Neural Networks* were used:

To run this project, please follow this steps:
- Have a database with brand images
- Put the correct paths in `DataProcessing.ipynb` and follow the `Initial Instructions`
- Run `DataProcessing.ipynb`
- Put the correct paths in `Top5Similarities.ipynb`
- Run `Top5Similarities.ipynb`

In the end, the result should look similar to this:
